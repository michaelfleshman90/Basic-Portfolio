            <p class="normal"><img src="assets/images/joker.jpg">Here's some information about me, I was born march 20th 1990. Born in the state of Delaware but moved to North Carolina shortly after and have lived here all of my life. A few things I like to do in my free time include spending time with my family, playing video games, and cooking.
            I have worked for Farley's Pizzeria for 7 years and have managed for about 5 years, I have learned alot about cooking and working with people. As much as I enjoy cooking and being in a hot kitchen all day im ready for a change of pace.</p>
